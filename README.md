Frontend Assessment


Welcome to my assessment submission for the frontend developer role!

For this assessment, I was given a Figma design that included Login, Dashboard, User page, and User details page, and I was tasked with building these pages using React and TypeScript. In addition to visual fidelity and code quality, the assessment also required me to apply best practices in design and architecture, implement positive and negative unit tests, and make the design responsive to media types.

To retrieve data for the User pages, I used a mock API with 500 records. I also stored and retrieved user details on the User details page using local storage. For styling, I used SCSS to process my styles.

I made sure to follow good variable and function naming conventions and maintained consistency throughout my code. My Github repository contains clear and concise documentation, a detailed commit history, and well-written commit messages to help anyone who reviews my code to understand what I have done and why.

I am confident that my submission meets all of the assessment requirements, and I am excited for the opportunity to discuss my work with the Engineering Manager during the technical interview.
